## Usage
Once you've installed the theme, you're ready to work on your Jekyll site. To start off, I would recommend updating `_config.yml` with your site's details.

To build and serve your site, run:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

And you're all set! Head over to http://127.0.0.1:4000/ to see your site in action.
